# Airline-Ticketing-System

In this project we are working with an airline company that operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. They have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and their primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for all passengers.However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, we are conducting an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.
